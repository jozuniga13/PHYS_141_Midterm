First meeting: Mon Feb 28.

! Attention: for ease of collaboration and cross-checking, please use variables as outlined below, so that adjustments can be easier. The function name and its parameters are only written down for reference. I am only day-dreaming all the setups --Yuntong

"init.c" -> set up the initial conditions of the disk particles and center of the two galaxies
1. A function 'populate(n,Rmin,r1,r2,x,y,z)' to populate two disks. r1 is the center of mass coordinate of the galaxy A and r2 galaxy B. The goal is to create 11 concentric (circular) rings of 297 particles of mass m in each disk. Each ring has radius 0.2(0.05)0.7Rmin (that means each ring increases radius by 0.05 Rmin. The innermost ring should have 0.2Rmin as radius, the outermost 0.7Rmin). Rmin=25kpc. The center of each disk is a sun-like object with mass M. Remember that at all times,
r1+r2=0.
What we don't know is: Rinit.
M=10^11 solar mass. m does not matter since we are using leapfrog to compute their positions.
2. A function "printpos(x,y,z)" to print the x,y,z arrays of the 297*2 particles to a "posi.dat" file.
3. The separation of the two disks (or the two suns) is Rinit. The constraints on the initial separation at t=tinit (not zero) are that: first, at t=0,
4. Set up the initial velocities.


'evolve.c'
The disk particles do not interact with each other. The centre of mass of each galaxy is just the core (at all times). The disk particles are given an initial velocities so that the circular shapes are maintained (should be simple math)
1. The relative coordinate vector (centre of mass A-centre of mass B) traces out an elliptical orbit.
